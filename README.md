one off mini projects

Some of these programs come from here: https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/7-silly-programming-challenges-to-do-for-fun/

Others are from other sources or little projects I thought were interesting and wanted to write a program for.

How to build and run:
 > cd <project-dir>
 > mvn clean install
 > java -jar target/<project-name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
